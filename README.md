# BugChat
Imagine a situation when you are working on a project on your local ide or console. And you get a bug/error/doubt in between. So, in mnay projects these bugs are siminlar 
and it is possible that your teammates may have already faced them earlier. So, whenevr you get an error you can just type the error in your console and it will give you either a "Solution" which
other user may have faced and used the method to solve it. It is also possible that the same error was seen before but the solution was not saved by the developer. In that case name and details of that developer would be returned.
So, you can directly connect with them using console.

And if nothing works then this is a console based chatting application where you can chat with your teammates from console/command line/Ide directly. "For Funnn"
