# BugChat
Imagine a situation when you are working on a project on your local ide or console. And you get a bug/error/doubt in between. So,these bugs might be similar to what your teammates have seen.
So, whenevr you get an error you can just copy the error in your console and it will give you either a "Solution" which
other user may have faced and used the method to solve it. 
It is also possible that the same error was seen before but the solution was not saved by the developer. In that case name and details of that developer would be returned.
So, you can directly connect with them using console.

And if nothing works then this is a console based chatting application where you can chat with your teammates from console/command line/Ide directly. "For Funnn"
